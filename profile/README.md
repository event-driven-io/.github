## Welcome to Event-Driven.io

Our goal is to help you build applications close to business. We aim to bring you tools and learning resources that help you focus on delivering value. Event-driven Architecture and Event Sourcing are good foundations for doing that. 

We believe that Event Sourcing and Event-Driven Architecture can be simple, and that's why our tools bring you boilerplate-free practices.

All of that is backed by the years-long practical experience of the founder [Oskar Dudycz](https://github.com/oskardudycz/) and the rest of the contributors.

## Sponsorship

🙏 If you used our tools, learned from our resources and would like to help me make our community work sustainable - a monthly contribution would mean A WHOLE LOT. GitHub stars and Nuget downloads don't pay the bills. Hopefully, with your support, I'll be continuing our community work and do it not only in overtime 😛

You can support our work at [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oskardudycz).
